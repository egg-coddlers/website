<h1>
    Syracuse - Pattern SY-UNK19 (Pink Flowers and Buds)
</h1>

    This pattern consists of pink flowers and buds.  This pattern is
    extremely similar to
    <a href="../SY-UNK07/">Pattern SY-UNK07</a>
    with only a few subtle differences.  Please
    <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>
    if you own one of these coddlers ... we'd like to verify this
    pattern better.

An interesting glitch to note on the backstamp above ... it would seem
that the backstamp was applied by machine or some other automated
fashion ... a misalignment or mis-stamp of the backstamping equipment
led to the partial "extra backstamp" to the right of the backstamp on
this coddler.

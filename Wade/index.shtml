    <h1>Wade Coddlers</h1>

    <p>
    Wade coddlers are made of pottery, including the lid.  They are
    typically a dull brownish-bluish-green, and there is plenty of
    variation in colours found.
    </p>

    <br />
    <a name="Sizes"></a>

    <h2>Sizes/Shapes</h2>
    <p>
      Wade coddlers come in a <i>single</i> and a <i>double</i>
      size.
      </p>
    
    <p>
      The single size is just under 3 inches tall (measured to the top of
      the lifting ring), and 2 &frac12; inches in diameter at the mouth.
      The base is 1 <sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inches in diameter.

    <p>
      The double size is 4 to 4 &frac14; inches tall, and 2 &frac12;
      inches in diameter at the mouth, and the base is

      <h4>Glossy Brownish Bluish Green - A.S. Cooper Backstamp</h4>

    <p>
      This backstamp consists of the words <b>MADE IN IRELAND</b>
      and <b>A.S. COOPER</b>.  There are several speculations about who
      A.S. Cooper was, or their relationship to Wade.  According to a
      correspondant in Bermuda, we have learned the following:
      <ul>
	A.S Cooper & Sons is one of the Largest China Stores here in 
	Bermuda. They have been established since the late 1800's.  They
	brought in a lot of the Irish Wade products and I assume that they
	had them marked with there own store 'Logo' for publicity.
      </ul>
    </p>
      
    <p>
      There are two body style variations of these coddlers.  Some of these
      coddlers have the row of shamrocks completely encircling the body of
      the coddler.  The backstamp lettering on these coddlers is flat.
      Other coddlers with this backstamp have the rows of shamrocks
      interrupted by two pairs of smooth vertical columns, similar to those
      found on the
      <a href="#PlainDarkBrownAmber">
	plain dark brown amber coddlers mentioned earlier</a>.  The coddlers
      with the vertical columns have a backstamp in relief (the letters
      extend out beyond the surface of the backstamp).

<h1>Jenaer Glas Egg Coddlers</h1></a>

<p>
These are single and double convex coddlers made of clear glass.
Both sizes are 3&frac12; inches tall.   Each coddler was sold with
a clip to hold the lid to the body during cooking.
</p>

<p>
These coddlers were manufactured in Jena, Germany, by
<a href="http://www.schott.com/">
Schott</a>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/http://www.schott.com/labware/english/hwg/applications/year/egg.html">
Jenaer Glas GmbH. Household Glass Division</a>.
The original design of this coddler is attributed to
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/http://www.schott.com/labware/english/hwg/products/special.html">
Wilhelm Wagenfeld</a>
in 1933.
They were sold by various retailers, including Divertimenti of
England.
</p>

<p>
In March of 2005, the production of consumer glassware in Jena was
terminated. Sales of Schott Jenaer Glas will continue through the end
of 2005. The
<a href="http://www.us.schott.com/english/news/press.html?NID=120">
press release can be read here</a>. We are inquiring whether this is
the end of the Wagenfeld egg coddler.
</p>

<p>
We have seen the these coddlers available for sale online at
<a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com">Williams-Sonoma</a>
(item #4828638), and other tableware retailers.

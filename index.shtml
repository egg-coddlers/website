	This web site is dedicated to the study of <b>egg coddlers</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
	An egg coddler is a porcelain or pottery cup with a lid
	that was designed to prepare food ... in particular, an
	egg dish that is called <b>coddled eggs</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
	This site intends to be an information resource and
	a forum for collectors and users of egg coddlers.
      </p>

      <p>
	Data shown on this web site should not be assumed to be
	100% exhaustive, complete or correct. We try to verify all
	information and when it is questionable we will say so.
	We also still have a substantial backlog of data to add to the
	site.
      </p>

      <p>
	We need your help to keep this site useful! If you know of
	<a href="manufacturers.shtml">manufacturers</a>,
	<a href="pattern-xref.shtml">patterns</a>,
	<a href="/recipes/">recipes</a>, examples, or
	any other information ... or if you have images of
	egg coddlers that you would like to share on this site, please
	<a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you are interested in egg coddlers, or coddled eggs, there
	is an online community on Facebook called the
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/28997366242/">Egg
	Coddlers Appreciation Society</a>. Matt Collyer created that
	group. The editors of this site did not create that community,
	but you can often find us lurking there.
      </p>

      <p>
	Finally, we would like to mention that the site is still
	alive and well (as of April 2019). Updates are going slowly,
	and we hope to migrate to a better management system that will
	make the site look better and be easier to update.

	This web site is dedicated to the study of <b>egg coddlers</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
	An egg coddler is a porcelain or pottery cup with a lid
	that was designed to prepare food ... in particular, an
	egg dish that is called <b>coddled eggs</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
	This site intends to be an information resource and
	a forum for collectors and users of egg coddlers.
      </p>

      <p>
	Data shown on this web site should not be assumed to be
	100% exhaustive, complete or correct. We try to verify all
	information and when it is questionable we will say so.
	We also still have a substantial backlog of data to add to the
	site.
      </p>

      <p>
	We need your help to keep this site useful! If you know of

	If you are interested in egg coddlers, or coddled eggs, there
	is an online community on Facebook called the
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/28997366242/">Egg
	Coddlers Appreciation Society</a>. Matt Collyer created that
	group. The editors of this site did not create that community,
	but you can often find one or both of us lurking there.
      </p>

      <p>
	Finally, we would like to mention that the site is still
	alive and well (as of November 2021). We are in the process of
	migrating to a new structure and layout. 
        You will see the new site if you

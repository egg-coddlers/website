    <p>
      Here are some recipes so that you can use your egg coddler as it was
      originally intended to be used.  Please do exercise some caution,
      especially if you are using an older coddler, as cooking with it will
      show signs of wear after a while.  If you are collecting coddlers in
      mint condition, you will want to acquire a few inexpensive coddlers to
      use for your dining table.

      <h1>Cooking</h1>

      <ul>
	<li>During cooking, the egg coddler <b>should not</b>
	  be totally submerged in boiling water.  Stand the egg coddler in a
	  pan of boiling water
	  <b>taking care that the water level only reaches halfway up the
	    body of the coddler</b>.</li>

	<br />
	
	<li>Egg coddlers <b>should not</b> be used in a microwave oven.</li>

	<br />

	<li>Egg coddlers <b>should not</b> be exposed to an open flame,
	  nor placed directly on the burner of an electric range.</li>

	<br />

	<li><b>Food Safety Note</b>.  Eating undercooked eggs poses an
	  increased risk of contracting a food-borne illness, such as
	  Salmonella poisoning.   Children, the elderly, and anyone with
	  a depressed immune system, are at high risk.  Please cook your
	  eggs according to your own tastes, but keep in mind your health
	  risks as well.  Also, be sure to avoid allowing cooked foods to
	  come into contact with surfaces or utensils that have been used to
	  handle raw food.</li>
	

      </ul>

      <br />

      <a name="Cleaning"></a>
      <h1>Cleaning</h1>
      
      <ul>
	<li>According to
	  <a href="/RoyalWorcester/">
	    Royal Worcester</a>,
	  porcelain egg coddlers can be washed in the dishwasher.  We do not
	  recommend this.</li>

	<br />
	
	<li>We recommend that coddlers be soaked in a weak solution of mild
	  dish soap and warm water for cleaning.  Do not soak with the lid
	  affixed to the body of the coddler.</li>

	<br />

	<li>Do not use abrasive scouring pads, cloths, brushes, or powders
	  on the coddler.  This may damage decorations or the glaze.  If
	  there are stubborn residues, it is recommended that repetitive
	  soaking and then gentle scrubbing with a soft wash cloth be used.
	  A very soft toothbrush could be used, very gently, to remove
	  stains or residues.</li>

	<br />

	<li>Air dry the ceramic or porcelain body in a dish rack.
	  Towel-dry the stainless steel or metal sections carefully.  Do not
	  apply the lid to the coddler until all parts of the lid and the
	  body are <b>completely</b> dry.  Otherwise, the metal lid may fuse
	  to the body.</li>

      </ul>

      <br />

      <a name="Handling"></a>
      <h1>Handling</h1>
      
      <ul>
	<li>The lifting ring must <b>never</b> be used to tighten or loosen
	  the top of the coddler.  The ring should be used only to lift
	  coddlers out of the water bath, or lower them into the water
	  bath.  Any torque (rotational force) placed on the ring may cause
	  it to separatefrom the lid.</li>

	<br />

	<li>When cooking with the coddler, do not screw the lid on very
	  tightly.  A loose turn is sufficient.</li>

	<br />

	<li>When lifting the coddler out of boiling water, do not set it
	  directly onto a cold heat-conductive surface (such as a
	  countertop, or the sink).  Place the coddler on a trivet, a towel,
	  or other heat-insulating surface.  This will avoid shattering due
	  to rapid temperature change. (The coddlers are designed to
	  withstand thermal shock ... but why take chances?).</li>

	<br />
	
	<li>The sooner you wash, or at least soak, the egg coddler after
	  the egg has been cooked in it, the less likely that there will be
	  difficult residue
	  <a href="#Cleaning">to clean later</a>.</li>

	<br />
	
	<li>When storing coddlers for extended periods of time, it is best
	  to keep the lid attached to the coddler as loosely as possible
	  ... this will help avoid fusing if there is much humidity in the
	  air. </li>

	<br />

	<li>If coddlers are stored for long periods of time, dusting them
	  and inspecting them for rust spots or fusing is recommended.
	  Coddlers enjoy
	  <a href="#Cleaning">a nice bath</a>
	  occasionally, especially after a long journey or having sat for
	  many months on a collector's shelf.</li>

      <h1>Recipes</h1>

    <p>
      Recipes that call for one egg are for single coddlers, though you
      can always make one egg in a double.  For double coddlers, double
      the recipe.

    <h2>Ham and Egg - From
      <a href="/RoyalWorcester/">Royal Worcester</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <ul>
	<li>Butter - &frac14; teaspoon</li>
	<li>One egg</li>
	<li>Cooked ham - &frac12; oz (15g)</li>
	<li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>
      
      <li>Butter the inside of the coddler and the inside of the metal lid.
	(You can use a brush for this.  You can also use margarine, or a
	non-caloric non-stick spray such as <i>Pam</i> if you are trying
	to cut out the butter).</li>
      
      <li>Cut the ham into fine strips and line the inside of the coddler
	with the ham strips.</li>
      
      <li>Break the egg into the coddler, season with salt and pepper.
	(If you have bad luck breaking eggs without the shells, break the
	egg into a small bowl, inspect for shells, then pour the broken
	egg into the coddler).</li>
      
      <li>Screw on the lid and stand the coddler in a pan of boiling water,
	taking care that the water level only reaches
	<b>halfway up</b>
	the porcelain body.</li>
      
      <li>Simmer for 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
      
      <li>Remove the coddler from the water using the end of a fork/spoon
	through the lifting ring.  Alternatively, you could lift using
	oven mitts or other heat-proof gloves.</li>

      <li>Set the coddler on a towel, or trivet ... not on a cold
	heat-conductive surface, such as a counter top.  Using a towel and
	holding the lid by the rim, <b>not by the lifting ring</b>,
	twist the lid to loosen it.</li>
      
      <li>Serve at the table in the coddler.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation and Cooking - From
      <a href="/Wedgwood/">Wedgwood</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Butter the inside of the egg coddler and metal lid.</li>
      
      <li>Break one or two eggs (according to size of the coddler) into the
	cup, and season to taste with pepper and salt.</li>
      
      <li>Screw on the lid (grasping the whole top -- do not use lifting 
	-- ring alone).</li>
      
      <li>Stand the egg coddler up to its neck in a pan of boiling  water
	and simmer for time stated.</li>
      
      <li>Lift from pan and serve.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <br />

    Small size Wedgwood egg coddler:
    <ul>
      One large egg - 5&frac12; minutes<br />
      One medium egg - 5 minutes<br />
    </ul>

    <br />
    
    Large size Wedgwood egg coddler:
    <ul>
      Two large eggs - 8&frac12; minutes<br />
      Two medium eggs - 6&frac12; minutes<br />
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      There are many ingredients which can be added to the eggs in the
      coddler to make an unusual and delectable dish, demanding very little
      extra time in preparing. Try chopped chervil, chives and cream. Flaked
      crab, shrimp or tuna fish. Lightly sauteed chopped chicken
      liver. Gruyere, or a soft cheese, with chopped onion and mushroom. Or
      smoked sausage. When using raw ingredients a two minute longer cooking
      time in the coddler may be preferred.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Editor's Note:</i>
      <a href="/Wedgwood/">Wedgwood</a>
      recommends submerging their coddler to its neck, while
      <a href="/RoyalWorcester/">Royal Worcester</a>
      explicitly implores you to never submerge the coddler beyond the
      middle of its belly.  Their timings are also rather different.  Our
      suspicion is that your coddler will last much longer if you follow the
      Royal Worcester directions, but your breakfast will be ready faster
      if you follow the Wedgwood directions.  Ultimately, you must decide
      upon your  priorities, as well as how well-coddled you like your
      eggs.

    <h2>Coddled Eggs a la Mexicana</h2>

    This recipe was contributed by <b>Peter Young</b>:
    <ul>    
      For a totally new twist on an old tradition: <br />
      Add a few pieces of cooked chorizo and some diced serrano peppers
      to eggs in a buttered coddler and cook as usual.  Very nice.

    <h2>Michael Carroll's Recipes, Tips, and Comments about Coddling Eggs</h2>

    <p>
      First, some comments:<br />
      I have had three types of egg coddlers:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Royal Worcester in both single and double-egg sizes.</li>
      <li>A nameless white porcelain that holds about a half-tablespoon
	more contents than the large Royal Worcester.</li>
      <li>A wider and flatter two egg glass cup with spring clamp for
	the lid - holding about as much as the large Royal Worcester.
      </li>
    </ol>    

    <p>
      The Royal Worcester is incomparable.  We purchased ours in England
      over 35 years ago, and used them on a fairly regular basis (once a
      fortnight).  The lid is as shiny as ever.  The stainless steel
      threadtop on the porcelain cup is still securely bound.  The
      porcelain looks new.  These cups have been submitted to stress of
      many kinds.  They have been washed in dishwashers.  They have been
      filled to the brim during cooking (I recommend leaving some air
      space so the screw threadtop does not separate from the cup).  I
      have always used a fork with gentle tension to remove the cap from
      the cup  and the metal ring has in no way been weakened or bent.
    </p>

    <p>    
      The nameless white porcelain cup has a couple of serious flaws.
      While the porcelain itself is sturdy and has shown no signs of
      wear nor has any ever broken, the stainless steel is cheap, and
      the lid tends to rust despite being given the best of care (I
      recommend a thin coat of cooking oil to be applied after washing
      and drying).  Worse the threadtop is not well bound to the cup.
      Over-filling will result in the top being pushed off from within
      by heat expansion of the ingredients.  Moreover, the seal is not
      uniform, and once the ring is pushed off, a distasteful mass of
      debris is revealed that had previously penetrated the seal into
      the ring in the cup side of the ring.  Once the user realizes that
      this debris was constantly in touching distance of the contents of
      the cup, it tends to be rather offputting. On the plus-side, the
      slightly larger cup allows for many more interesting recipes than
      the rather limited large cup of the Royal Worcester.  The few
      recipes I mention below can be accomodated in the large Royal
      Worcester cups by removing about 1-2 teaspoons of egg white. </p>

    <p>
      The glass cups with spring clamp are never going to be the same
      kind of collector's item, but they have a few good things going
      for them:  There is no bound construction.  Since the lid is
      clamped on the cup by an external (somewhat ornate) spring clamp
      (easily applied or removed in about two seconds), there is no
      worry about the binding of the threadring to the cup or any
      materials being caught in that space. 
      Springing is an absolute breeze.  There are no tiny recesses to
      contain food bits, and the clear cup is easy to check for
      clingers. Cooking times are virtually identical with that of the
      porcelain cups.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only other minus is that removing the spring and lid from a
      hot cup is a bit more challenging than with the traditional
      porcelain.  The lid has nothing with which to grip it, so one
      must use a potholder or towel rather than the tines of a fork
      that work so well with the porcelain versions. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Recipes:  (for two egg cups)  One master recipe with variations
      suggested.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start water in large pot to boiling.</li>

      <li>Using paper towel or fingertips very lightly oil the
	interior with your choice of butter, olive oil, or other cooking
	oil.</li>

      <li>Add two shelled eggs, medium to large if you have room -
	small, otherwise. </li>

      <li>Add cheese.  I use about a teaspoon worth of any of the
	following and am constantly experimenting:  sharp cheddar,
	gruyere, emmanthaler, ... </li>

      <li>Cream or sour cream -- about 1 1/2 teaspoons worth.</li>

      <li>Seasonings:  salt, pepper, any of the following:
	<ul>
	  <li>Bulb of one green onion (scallion), skinned of the thick
	    outside, minced or cut with a kitchen scissors (subtle and flavor
	    changing without standing out -- my favorite)</li>
	  
	  <li>Fresh or dried chives (1/2 teaspoon of the former  1/4
	    teaspoon of the later).  (Pleasing accent, a bit more noticeable
	    than the green onion).</li>
	  
	  <li>Fresh or dried parsley (same amount as chives above).  Adds
	    "completeness" to taste and can be used in combination with any of
	    the other spices or herbs. </li>
	  
	  <li>1/8 teaspoon (pinch) of sage.  (Slightly different --
	    for a change).</li>
	  
	  <li>1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of dried onion pieces (instead of chives
	    or scallions, for hardier flavor)</li>

	  <li>1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice.  Exquisite.
	    (Basically, a way to emulate the taste of Hollandaise sauce when
	    used in tandem with cream or sour cream, without adding a
	    tablespoon of butter per egg.  In a dish with already more
	    cholesterol than decent, this can be a real benefit).  If you want
	    the lemon to stand out for piquancy, try up to 1 teaspoon of the
	    juice.</li>

	  <li>Instead of the lemon, try chopped fresh tomato bits, in
	    tandem or not with the cream or sour cream.  Distinctive and
	    reminiscent of huevos rancheros, southwest style.  You can even
	    combine tomato and lemon for a dish as citric as it is
	    eggy!</li>
	  
	  <li>For those inclined to spicy: minced pieces of canned or
	    frozen hot green chile (thousand times better than the insipid
	    powdered red chile, which comes from dried, powdered green chiles
	    that have been allowed to redden).  Be sure to wash hands well
	    after handling the chile -- I use baking power.</li>
	</ul>
	
      <li>Note:  I sometimes top off the contents with milk (but not
	if I am adding lemon or anything citric, in which case I sometimes
	add white wine).  My goal is to leave sufficient space for air to
	absorb the expansion of the ingredients -- a truly important
	factor if you are using any porcelain other than Royal
	Worcester.</li>

      <li>
	Seal cup, place in boiling water almost up to the bottom of the
	lid and cook between a simmer and a boil for 12 minutes (this is
	at high altitudes -- lower altitudes can probably do with a lesser
	temperature).  The resulting egg should consist of a mostly runny
	yolk, a white that is partially runny, but not clear (with some
	little exception).  You will need to figure out your time for
	yourself, and should rely on this time of yours because once you
	begin adding liquids, you will not be able to tell by examination
	if the egg is cooked properly until you remove it from the cup.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Service:  Coddled eggs can be served right in their cups, but I
      almost never do that. My first choice by far are English muffins
      toasted crisp.  The dryness of toast makes it absorbent of all the
      wonderful flavors of the egg mixture.  Why waste anything?
      Moreover, coddled eggs slip all too fast into the digestive system
      -- muffins or toast extend them long enough to be truly
      appreciated.
    </p>
    
    <p>   
      In addition, I like to place on each muffin any of the following:
      <ul>
	<li>cooked bacon</li>
	<li>cooked ham</li>
	<li>ground sausage, but not enough to dominate the eggs subtlety.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <br />

    <h2>Some Recipe Suggestions from Susan</h2>

    <p>
      In addition to the more obvious additions of crumbled bacon, ham
      and mild grated cheese, for variety try instead a few flakes of
      previously  cooked mild white fish (ie: leftover poached or
      steamed or baked from the prior  night's meal). Put flaked fish in
      first if you're using a single egg or layer fish  between two
      small eggs.  If wished season with salt & pepper, poultry
      seasoning or  even a light touch of tobasco.  A few buttered bread
      crumbs on top is good assuming you don't mind moist crumbs.  Add a
      dash of paprika before screwing the top closed or just before
      serving.  (DON'T use regular pepper if you use paprika.  The two
      do not work well together.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We also have used flaked salmon (canned or the hot smoke variety)
      which some may find too strong, and at other times salmon pate.
      Shreaded lox (cold smoke style salmon)  probably would be
      interesting too.
    </p>
    
    <p>    
      Serve with a parsely sprig and thin curl of lemon rind or thin
      slice of  lemon.  We haven't tried it but a really up-scale
      garnish of caviar (black or red  we recently discovered salmon
      caviar which is yellow-orange and has a good flavor) likely would
      work too.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Mix and match flavors as suits you.

    <h2>Recipes from a Generic Egg Coddler</h2>

    <p>
      These recipes were included in a package of
      <a href="/AA-UncertainManu/UM51/">
	generic (cheap) egg coddlers</a>.
      The coddlers are double-sized, so I'd assume that these recipes
      work for any double-sized coddlers.

      <b>Coddled Eggs</b>
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      Grease the inside of the coddler with a small knob of butter.
      Break two eggs into the egg coddler and screw on the
      lid. Bring a pan of water to a gentle boil, place coddlers in
      the water and cook for 8-10 minutes.  Serve in the coddler.

      <b>Cheese Souffle Omelette</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Half ounce of butter</li>
      <li>One egg</li>
      <li>One ounce of grated cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <p>
	Place butter in egg coddler and stand in hot water. Separate
	yolk from white of egg, beat white until stiff. Beat egg yolk,
	add cheese and seasoning to yolk, fold in the white. Pour mixture
	into coddler and screw on lid. Stand in pan of water and simmer
	until set -- approximately 15-20 minutes.  Serve in
	coddler.

    </ul>

      <i>Editor's Note: I don't think the water should be boiling, if they
	are talking about 15-20 minutes cooking time.  I haven't tried
	this.</i>

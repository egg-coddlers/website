    <h2>What is the Age of (some specific example of) an egg coddler?</h2>
    <ul>
      <p>
	Despite years of research, we have not had much success in
	establishing the range of manufacture dates for most egg
	coddlers shown on this site. Some manufactures use specific
	date codes that indicate when the coddler was made.  Any
	date information that we have established is included on
	the site.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you have evidence of the manufacture date of an egg coddler
	on this site (for example ... a box or leaflet that came with
	a new egg coddler), please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.

    <h2>Where Can I Buy Egg Coddlers?</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <p>
	<b>New</b> egg coddlers can be bought at retail prices from
	the manufacturer or online retailer. We don't have a list of
	egg coddler manufacturers that are currently making coddlers
	for sale.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Most of the egg coddlers described by this web site are no longer
	available for retail sale. Egg coddlers that are no longer
	manufactured are available only from the "secondary market."  This
	makes the hunt as much of an adventure as the final
	acquisition. Shops that sell antiques and collectibles are a good  
	place to start, online and "brick & mortar."  Antiques/Collectible
	auctions seem to be the place where many egg coddlers exchange
	hands.
      </p>

      <p>    
	<a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
	is the biggest online auction site, although there are
	many others. You can search the site for keywords like
	<b>coddler</b> or <b>egg-coddler</b> to find most auctions
	of interest.
      </p>

    <h2>
      I seem to have an egg coddler with a pattern, design, or backstamp
      that doesn't match anything on your site.  What does this mean?
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
      <p>    
	The editors of this site are constantly acquiring new data and
	information about egg coddlers. However, updates to the website
	happen less frequently, and we have an incredible backlog of data
	and images to process.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you have seen an egg-coddler that does not match anything on
	our web site, either in your collection, or on sale (or that you
	plan to sell), please do 
	<a href="/contact/">contact us</a> to let us know.
	Digital images of the item are extremely helpful in identifying
	manufacturers, patterns, and variations. If you wish to send us
	digital images, use the contact form and we will send you an email
	address to which your images can be sent.

      How rare is (some specific example of) an egg coddler?<br>
      How valuable is (some specific example of) an egg coddler?<br>
      How much is my egg coddler collection worth?
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
      <p>
	The authors of
	<a href="/">this web site</a>
	have decided unanimously, and unequivocably, that we will not
	include specific pricing, rarity, or other valuation guidelines on
	this web site.  E-mail responses from editors of this web site will
	will also be responded to under the same policy.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	There are several fundamental reasons for this policy.  The most
	important reason is that we feel that such valuation data is often
	arbitrary, and causes unhealthy speculation in the "coddler
	marketplace".
      </p>
      
      <p>
	As with most collectibles, the value of a particular object is
	based entirely on what a seller is willing to accept from a buyer,
	both being able and willing to conduct their part of the
	transaction under mutually agreeable terms.  The fact that of the
	matter is that online auctions, such as 
	<a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
	have had an amazing impact on the coddler marketplace.  On the one
	hand, there are many more sellers who can make their goods visible
	to a much larger audience of buyers who are able to see what is
	available and add it to their collections.  On the other hand, the
	auction venue creates an additional factor, what I call the
	"winning hysteria," that tends to push the final price of
	auction items, even those that are available through retail
	channels, to amazingly high closing prices.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	We don't believe that maintaining a running tally of prices paid
	at auction for specific coddlers would be constructive (or
	feasible). Such a tally would also be extremely difficult to
	maintain accurately, and could also be perceived as a serious
	"conflict of interest." All site editors and contributors are
	buyers, collectors, and/or sellers of egg coddlers for their own
	collections.  Rather than create the possibility of inappropriate
	appearance, we simply will stay away from the valuation issue
	entirely.

    <h2>
      The chrome / silver rim of my egg coddler has separated from the
      ceramic part. How can I repair my coddler so that it can be used
      for cooking?
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
      <p>
	Since egg coddlers are used for cooking, any glue/adhesive used to
	repair the rim should be food safe when cured, waterproof, and
	maintain these properties when subjected to boiling temperatures
	and immersion in water. Such an adhesive also has to be capable of
	bonding metals and ceramics.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	We have not conducted tests of adhesives and we don't have the
	laboratory facilities to verify manufacturers claims. The editors
	make no guarantees or assurances that any glue can be safely
	used on an egg coddler that will be used for cooking. However, we
	have been told by the company that
	<a href="http://www.gorillaglue.com/">Gorilla Glue</a>
	is non-toxic after curing for 24 hours or longer, will create a
	waterproof bond between ceramic and metal that will hold to
	temperatures up to boiling. They say that exposing the cured glue
	to boiling water for more than 4 hours may cause the bond to
	fail.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	If you have experience with repair techniques for separated rims
	(good or bad), please
	<a href="/contact/">contact us</a>
	and let us know what you have used and how you fixed your
	coddlers.

<h2>What is the Age of (some specific example of) an egg coddler?</h2>
<ul>
  <p>
     Despite years of research, we have not had much success in
     establishing the range of manufacture dates for most egg
     coddlers shown on this site. Some manufactures use specific
     date codes that indicate when the coddler was made.  Any
     date information that we have established is included on
     the site.

<h2>Where Can I Buy Egg Coddlers?</h2>

<ul>
<p>
    <b>New</b> egg coddlers can be bought at retail prices.  The most
    consistently accessible coddlers for purchase new are those from
    <a href="/RoyalWorcester">Royal Worcester</a>.  Royal Worcester
    coddlers are often available in-stock or by special order from
    companies that specialize in China giftware.  Other brands of egg
    coddlers are sold new, either through the manufacturer, or a
    retail outlet.  We maintain a web page with information about
    where you might be able to find new egg coddlers at retail prices:
    &nbsp;
    <a href="/where-to-buy.shtml">
    http://www.egg-coddlers.com/where-to-buy.shtml</a>.
   </p>

<p>
    Most of the egg coddlers described by this web site are no longer
    available for direct retail sale. Egg coddlers that are no longer
    manufactured are available from the "secondary market."  This
    makes the hunt as much of an adventure as the final
    acquisition. Shops that sell antiques and collectibles are a good  
    place to start, online and "brick & mortar."  Antiques/Collectible
    auctions seem to be the place where many egg coddlers exchange
    hands. 
    </p>
<p>    
    <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
    is the biggest online auction site, although there are
    many others. You can search the site for keywords like
    <b>coddler</b> or <b>egg-coddler</b> to find most auctions
    of interest.
    </p>

<p>
    We have occasionally seen egg coddlers for sale at tableware
    replacements dealers, like
    <a href="http://www.replacements.com">
    Replacements.COM</a>,
    </p>

<h2>
    I seem to have an egg coddler with a pattern, design, or backstamp
    that doesn't match anything on your site.  What does this mean?
</h2>

<ul>
<p>    
    The editors of this site are constantly acquiring new data and
    information about egg coddlers. However, updates to the website
    happen less frequently, and we have an incredible backlog of data
    and images to process.
    </p>
<p>
    If you have seen an egg-coddler that does not match anything on
    our web site, either in your collection, or on sale (or that you
    plan to sell), please do 
    <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> to let us know.
    Digital images of the item are extremely helpful in identifying
    manufacturers, patterns, and variations. If you wish to send us
    digital images, use the contact form and we will send you an email
    address to which your images can be sent.
    </p>
<p>
    If you have photographs
    that you can't digitize, please send them by
    postal mail to:
    <b>Egg-Coddlers.COM, P.O. Box 207, Glen Echo MD 20817-0207,
    U.S.A.</b>.  Please do indicate whether you wish the photographs
    returned to you once we have scanned them, and how you wish to
    <a href="/acknowledgements.shtml">be acknowledged</a>.

<h2>
How rare is (some specific example of) an egg coddler?<br>
How valuable is (some specific example of) an egg coddler?<br>
How much is my egg coddler collection worth?
</h2>

<ul>
<p>
    The authors of
    <a href="/">this web site</a>
    have decided unanimously, and unequivocably, that we will not
    include specific pricing, rarity, or other valuation guidelines on
    this web site.  E-mail responses from editors of this web site will
    will also be responded to under the same policy.
    </p>

    <p>
    There are several fundamental reasons for this policy.  The most
    important reason is that we feel that such valuation data is often
    arbitrary, and causes unhealthy speculation in the "coddler
    marketplace".
    </p>

    <p>
    As with most collectibles, the value of a particular object is
    based entirely on what a seller is willing to accept from a buyer,
    both being able and willing to conduct their part of the
    transaction under mutually agreeable terms.  The fact that of the
    matter is that online auctions, such as 
    <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
    have had an amazing impact on the coddler marketplace.  On the one
    hand, there are many more sellers who can make their goods visible
    to a much larger audience of buyers who are able to see what is
    available and add it to their collections.  On the other hand, the
    auction venue creates an additional factor, what I call the
    "winning hysteria," that tends to push the final price of
    auction items, even those that are available through retail
    channels, to amazingly high closing prices.
    </p>

<p>
    We don't believe that maintaining a running tally of prices paid
    at auction for specific coddlers would be constructive (or
    feasible). Such a tally would also be extremely difficult to
    maintain accurately, and could also be perceived as a serious
    "conflict of interest." All site editors and contributors are
    buyers, collectors, and/or sellers of egg coddlers for their own
    collections.  Rather than create the possibility of inappropriate
    appearance, we simply will stay away from the valuation issue
    entirely.

<h2>
    The chrome / silver rim of my egg coddler has separated from the
    ceramic part. How can I repair my coddler so that it can be used
    for cooking?
    </h2>

<ul>
<p>
    Since egg coddlers are used for cooking, any glue/adhesive used to
    repair the rim should be food safe when cured, waterproof, and
    maintain these properties when subjected to boiling temperatures
    and immersion in water. Such an adhesive also has to be capable of
    bonding metals and ceramics.
    </p>

<p>
    We have not conducted tests of adhesives and we don't have the
    laboratory facilities to verify manufacturers claims. The editors
    make no guarantees or assurances that any glue can be safely
    used on an egg coddler that will be used for cooking. However, we
    have been told by the company that
    <a href="http://www.gorillaglue.com/">Gorilla Glue</a>
    is non-toxic after curing for 24 hours or longer, will create a
    waterproof bond between ceramic and metal that will hold to
    temperatures up to boiling. They say that exposing the cured glue
    to boiling water for more than 4 hours may cause the bond to
    fail.
    </p>
<p>
    If you have experience with repair techniques for separated rims
    (good or bad), please
    <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>
    and let us know what you have used and how you fixed your
    coddlers.

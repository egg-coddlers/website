<h1>Solidex Egg Coddlers</h1></a>

We know of the existance of at least one egg coddler by this
manufacturer because it recently appeared for sale
<a href="/sources/#EA">at auction on eBay</a>.
<p>
The seller of this coddler had it with the original box and
instructions for its use English and French.
All the lettering on the outside of the box is in English.
The coddler was distributed under licence by an English firm
called Murell Ltd for the French manufacturers.  The seller believes
that this coddler dates from the 1950's.

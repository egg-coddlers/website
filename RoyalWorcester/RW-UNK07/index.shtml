<h1>
Royal Worcester - RW-UNK07 (World War II Plane in Flight)
</h1>

<p>
    This pattern shows a World War II plane in flight.
    One of our contacts has shown these images to people at Royal
    Worcester.  They believe that the image may have been done by
    hand by someone.  It isn't an official Royal Worcester decal that
    was ever used by the factory.  It could have been done by someone
    in the factory,  or after it left the factory.  The coddler was
    probably a
    <a href="../RW-UNK02/">RW-UNK02 (plain white)</a>
    that was later decorated with the plane.

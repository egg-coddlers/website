    Where to Buy Recent RW Egg Coddlers
</h1>

<p>
    Royal Worcester (RW) still produces and sells their egg coddlers
    as a retail item.  <a href="/sources/#BB">Bruce</a> says that they
    also have, in the past, and probably will again, make up a few
    coddlers of whatever design is handy when they have space in their
    kilns.  Perhaps these are sold at the RW shop, in Worcester,
    England.

<p>
    I have not yet found a web page for Royal Worcester (RW) online.
    It is only a matter of time before they have one.  We will
    maintain a list here of retail establishments, online or "brick
    and mortar," where we've seen or heard of RW coddlers for sale.
    Your local gift shop is probably a good place to look for them too
    ... there might be one gathering dust on a shelf.  Listing here is
    not an endorsement of these vendors ... just a point of reference.

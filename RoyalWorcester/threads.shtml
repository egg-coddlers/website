    <h1>Screw Threads on Royal Worcester Coddlers</h1>

    <p>
      The screw threads on the lids of Royal Worcester (RW) coddlers
      varies by pitch (or number of lines in the thread).  The screw
      threads at the top of the coddler itself also varies in pitch, and
      the material from which the top rim of the coddler is made.  Most
      of the coddler top rims were made of metal (stainless steel),
      except the rims used in <a href="types/#Type10">Type 10</a>.
      The rims of Type 10 coddlers (and a possible sub-type
      of <a href="types/#Type9">Type 9</a>) have a rim made of white
      nylon.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The screw threads of RW coddler types
      <a href="types/#Type1">Type 1</a>
      through
      <a href="types/#Type7">Type 7</a>
      have the finger-pitched, or tighter
      screw threads.  These are indicative of an older coddler.  The screw
      threads of RW coddler types
      <a href="types/#Type8">Type 8</a>
      through
      <a href="types/#Type12">Type 12</a>
      have the coarser-pitched, sometimes referred to as having "fewer"
      threads.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can count three or four threads on the <u>lid</u> of a coddler of
      <a href="types/#Type7">Type 7</a>
      or earlier, Standard or King Size.   You can count four or five
      threads on the <u>top</u> of a coddler of Type 7 or earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can count one or two threads on the <u>lid</u> of a coddler of
      <a href="types/#Type8">Type 8</a>
      or later, Standard or King Size.  You can count three or four
      threads on the <u>top</u> of a coddler of Type 8 or later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coddlers with a backstamp indicating
      <a href="types/#Type7">Type 7</a>
      (or earlier) but with lids with fewer screw threads have, most
      likely, had their lid replaced.  Conversely, the presence of a
      finer-pitched lid alone should not be used as compelling evidence that
      the coddler is of an older
      <a href="types/">type</a>.

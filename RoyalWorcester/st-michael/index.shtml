    <h1>
      Royal Worcester - Hedgerow for St. Michael's
    </h1>

    <p>
      This pattern consists of stylized leaves.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This pattern was
      manufactured by Royal Worcester for St. Michael's, a large
      department store in the U.K. According to
      <a href="/sources/#MN">Mandy Newman</a>
      and her contact at St. Michael's, this coddler was manufactured 
      to be part of a complete dinner service in this pattern.  It was only
      available for twelve to twenty-four months until the pattern became
      obsolete.  As far as we know, this is the only coddler made for
      St. Michael's.  St. Michael's is also known as Marks & Spencer.

    <h1>
      Royal Worcester Patterns
    </h1>

    <p>

      These pages contain descriptions and low-resolution images of the
      patterns that Royal Worcester (RW) used on their egg coddlers over the
      years.  In many cases, there are several different motifs that are
      associated with each pattern name.  In other cases, we have pictures
      of the coddler but we don't know what the name of the pattern is.  To
      see images of coddlers with the patterns shown (or described), and to
      learn more about this particular pattern, you must click on the name
      and/or the image.

    <p>
      We have broken up this section into multiple pages so that you can
      browse patterns in a reasonable amount of time. 
      Each page is numbered, and will
      include a navigation block at the top and the bottom to let you
      browse other pages.  The ordering of the patterns in most of the
      pages is 
      <a href="/sources/#BB">Bruce's</a>.  He states:
      <ul>
	The coddler designs that I know of are listed in what I believe to be
	roughly the order of their introduction -- based on the known
	<a href="../types/">"Types"</a>.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Patterns on the last pages do not conform to Bruce's order,
      or any order at all.  As we learn more about those, they will
      drift into where we believe they belong in Bruce's ordering
      scheme.
    </p>

    <p>    
      If you have an egg coddler from Royal Worcester (or any
      <a href="/manufacturers.shtml">manufacturer</a>) that is
      not shown and/or described on the web site, 
      please do
      <a href="/contact/">let us know</a>.
      We want to provide as complete a reference guide online as is
      possible, and we need everyone's help to do that.

<h1>Types of Royal Worcester Coddlers</h1>

In order to differentiate between different Royal Worcester (RW)
coddlers with the same or similar
<a href="../patterns.shtml">pattern</a>,
we use a combination of characteristics of the coddler.  The
nomenclature of "types" is
<a href="/sources/#BB">Bruce's</a>.
As more data becomes available to us, some of these types may change.
There are nine major types of RW coddlers, which will be designated
with an Arabic numeral (Type 1 through Type 9).  There are variations
of the major types that we will call sub-types.  Each unique subtype
will be designated by an Arabic numeral followed by English alphabet
letter.  This page describes all RW types and subtypes.

<p>
<ul>
<b>Note:</b> The designation of "type" is entirely ours ... RW nor any
other authority on porcelain or pottery will have the faintest idea
what you are talking about if you say you have a
<a href="Type3E">Type 3E</a> RW egg coddler.
</ul>

<p>
The characteristics of a coddler that are used to determine the type
of coddler are
<a href="../backstamps.shtml">the backstamp</a>
and
<a href="../threads.shtml">the screw threads</a>.  In many
cases, we may refer to a backstamp style by the type of coddler upon
which it was seen.   However, two types of coddler, or two sub-types
of coddler, are distinguished from one another by the combination of
backstamp impression, color of the backstamp, method of application
of the backstamp to the coddler, material and spacing of the screw
threads, and other discernable differences in manufacturing process or
visual characteristic, other than the
<a href="../patterns.shtml">pattern</a>.

<p>
<a name="Type1">
<h2>Type 1</h2></a>

Type 1 has a backstamp that consists of a shield with the words
<b>ROYAL CHINA WORKS</b> over the top and "Worcester" underneath.  The
backstamp also has a letter code indicating the manufacture date of
the coddler: "A" for 1891, "B" for 1892, and so on to "L" for 1902.
The
<a href="../threads.shtml">screw threads</a>
are finer-pitched.
<p>

<p>
<a name="Type2">
<h2>Type 2</h2></a>

Type 2 has a backstamp that consists of the characters <b>C51</b>
in a circle topped by a crown.  RW was founded in 1751, hence the
significance of C51 in their backstamp motifs.  Around the top of the
circle are the words <b>ROYAL WORCESTER</b>.
Beneath the circle appears <b>ENGLAND</b>.
There are banners on either side of the circle
in which the words <b>CROWN</b> and <b>WARE</b> appear.
The backstamp on Type 2 coddlers is dull green in color.  The
backstamp is underneath the glaze (i.e., it can't be scraped off with
a fingernail, although
<i>we don't recommend doing this as a test, especially on an older
coddler</i>).  Beneath the circle and above <b>ENGLAND</b>
is a date code that consists of various dots, squares, and circles.
<ul>
"Those that I've seen date from the 1920's and 1930's." -
<a href="/sources/#BB">BB</a>.
</ul>
The
<a href="../threads.shtml">screw threads</a>
are finer-pitched.
The pedestal is often smaller than on the other types of RW coddlers.

<h2>Type 3</h2></a>

Type 3 is actually a set of backstamps.  Most of the Type 3 backstamps
have <b>C51</b> in a circle topped by a crown.  Around the top of the
circle is written <b>ROYAL WORCESTER VITREOUS</b> or just
<b>ROYAL WORCESTER</b>.  Under the circle is written
<b>MADE IN ENGLAND</b> or just <b>ENGLAND</b>.  In some cases there
are additional words stamped or superimposed onto the basic design.
As with
<a href="#Type2">Type 2</a>,
the backstamp is dull green in color
(except
<a href="Type3E">Type 3E</a>)
and is underneath the glaze.
The
<a href="../threads.shtml">screw threads</a>
are finer-pitched.

<p>

#561564</b> in a box below the circle.  According to
<a href="/sources/#KM">KM</a>, this would be an English registry mark,
and if so, the design was registered in 1909.  This mark has been seen
on a coddler with a silver lid. (<a href="/sources/#BB">BB</a>).

<h2>Type 4</h2></a>

Type 4 coddlers have a backstamp that consists of the word
<b>ROYAL</b> above the word <b>WORCESTER</b> above the word
<b>ENGLAND</b> with no other lines or symbols.  The backstamp is dull
green and is underneath the glaze.
The
<a href="../threads.shtml">screw threads</a>
are finer-pitched.
<ul>
"I have seen one coddler that had the tighter screw pitch, but no
backstamp.  It was probably a factory error of
<a href="#Type4">Type 4</a>, the backstamp having been omitted during
production."

<h2>Type 5</h2></a>

Type 5 coddlers have a backstamp that includes the stylized script
<b>W</b> in a circle, with the words
<b>ROYAL WORCESTER</b> above the circle,
<b>PORCELAIN</b> beneath the circle,
and
<b>MADE IN ENGLAND</b> in smaller print below that.  
The backstamp is dull green and is underneath the glaze.
The
<a href="../threads.shtml">threads</a>
are the less dense (one or two threads on the lid, three or four on the
rim of the top), newer style.  Note that the sub-types Type 5A,
Type 5B, Type 5C, and Type 5D all have the finer-pitched screw
threads.  They are listed as a sub-type of Type 5 because of the
similarity in backstamp design.
<a href="/sources/#BB">Bruce</a> suspects that they predate Type 5 and
possibly
<a href="#Type4">Type 4</a> as well.

Across the top of the backstamp are the words
<b>MADE IN ENGLAND</b>.  This sub-type has
the finer-pitched
<a href="../threads.shtml">screw threads</a>.
This coddler was probably manufactured for the restaurant trade.

<h2>Type 6</h2></a>

Type 6 coddlers have a backstamp with the stylized script <b>W</b>
inside a circle. Outside the circle appears <b>ROYAL WORCESTER</b>

is black  and is imprinted over the glaze.

mean that there never was one."

the lower  right, inside a circle.  Outside the circle appears <b>ROYAL

is black and is imprinted over the glaze.  The rim of the coddler
is made of metal.  Type 7 differs from

7 differes from
<a href="Type8">Type 8</a>
only in that Type 8 has a nylon rim instead of metal.

WORCESTER</b> above and <b>PORCELAIN</b> below around the outside of

"<b>Note:</b> I have recently seen a coddler of the

that has a

I suspect that this was an interim stage between
Type 6 and Type 8, with the added implication that
Type 8 actually predates
<a href="#Type7">Type 7</a>, i.e., the nylon rim was
introduced before the Registered Trademark symbol was added
to the backstamp."

Backstamps of Royal Worcester Coddlers
</h1>

The backstamp of a Royal Worcester (RW) egg coddler is the main
characteristic, other than the
<a href="patterns/">pattern</a>
used to distinguish the
<a href="types/">type</a>
of coddler.  RW produced many coddlers using the same pattern
over the years. The backstamp (and the
<a href="threads.shtml">screw threads</a>) can be used to further
classify coddlers.

      Sizes of Royal Worcester Coddlers Produced
    </h1>

    <p>
      Royal Worcester (RW) produced four size of coddler - in increasing
      capacity.
    </p>
 
    <a name="standard"></a>

    <p>
      The <b>Standard Size</b> was designed to prepare one egg. It
      nominally measures 3&frac12; inches from the base to the top of
      the lifting ring, but there can be considerable variation -
      especially in the earlier coddlers, such as those with
      <a href="types/#Type1">Type 1 backstamps</a>.
      With the lid off, the coddler body stands nominally 2&frac12;
      inches tall. This size can also be used to warm up an individual
      serving of baby food. RW no longer produces this size of
      coddler.
    </p>

    <a name="king"></a>
    <p>
      The <b>King Size</b> was designed to prepare two eggs. It measures
      4 inches from the base to the top of the lifting ring.  With the
      lid off, the coddler body stands 3&frac14; inches tall.  It is
      approximately 2&frac12; inches in diameter. This is currently the
      only size of coddler that RW produces.
    </p>

    <a name="jumbo"></a>
    <p>
      The <b>Jumbo Size</b> was designed to replace the maxime (see
      below), intended for a small individual meal, such as a small
      stew. It measures 4&frac34; inches from the base to the top of the
      lifting ring.  With the lid off, the coddler body
      stands 3<font size="-2"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></font>
      inches tall - the same
      height as the maxime. It is approximately 3&frac14; inches in
      diameter, about a half inch narrower than the maxime. RW no longer
      produces this size of coddler.
    </p>

    <a name="maxime"></a>
    <p>
      The <b>Maxime Size</b> was designed to prepare a small individual
      meal, such as a small stew. It measures 5&frac14; inches from the
      base to the top of the lifting ring. With the lid off, the coddler
      body stands 3<font size="-2"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub></font>
      inches tall. It is approximately 3&frac34; inches in diameter.
      Royal Worcester no longer produces this size of coddler.

      Types of Royal Worcester Coddlers
    </h1>

    <p>
      In order to differentiate between different Royal Worcester (RW)
      coddlers with the same or similar
      <a href="../patterns/">pattern</a>,
      We use a combination of characteristics of the coddler.  The
      nomenclature of "types" is
      <a href="/sources/#BB">Bruce's</a>.
      As more data becomes available to us, some of these types may change.
      There are twelve major types of RW coddlers, which will be designated
      with an Arabic numeral (Type 1 through Type 12).  There are variations
      of the major types that we will call sub-types.  Each unique subtype
      will be designated by an Arabic numeral followed by English alphabet
      letter.  This page describes all RW types and subtypes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <b>Note:</b> The designation of "type" is entirely ours ... RW nor any
      other authority on porcelain or pottery will have the faintest idea
      what you are talking about if you say you have a
      <a href="#Type2A">Type 2A</a> RW egg coddler.
    </ul>

    <p>
      The characteristics of a coddler that are used to determine the type
      of coddler are the backstamp and
      <a href="../threads.shtml">the screw threads</a>.  In many
      cases, we may refer to a backstamp style by the type of coddler upon
      which it was seen.   However, two types of coddler, or two sub-types
      of coddler, are distinguished from one another by the combination of
      backstamp impression, color of the backstamp, method of application
      of the backstamp to the coddler, material and spacing of the screw
      threads, and other discernable differences in manufacturing process or
      visual characteristic, other than the
      <a href="../patterns/">pattern</a>.

    <h2>Type 1</h2>

    <p>
      Type 1 has a backstamp that consists of a shield with the words
      <b>ROYAL CHINA WORKS</b> over the top and <b>WORCESTER</b>
      underneath. 
      The
      <a href="../threads.shtml">screw threads</a>
      are finer-pitched.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This backstamp is actually the imprint of <b>George Grainger and
	Company</b>. The Grainger porcelain works was started in 1801 by
      Thomas Grainger.  The business had different names over the years as
      Grainger partnered with others: <b>Grainger and Wood</b>, <b>Grainger and
	Lee</b>. George Grainger took over the business when his father
      died in 1839.  The company was taken over by the <b>Worcester
	Royal Porcelain Company, Ltd.</b> and was operated by Royal
      Worcester until 1902.  The mark shown above was used from 1889
      to 1902, and it includes a date code, in the form of a letter,
      under <b>ENGLAND</b>, which indicates the year of
      production.  <b>A</b> for 1891, <b>B</b> for 1892, <b>C</b> for
      1893, and so on until <b>L</b> for 1902, the year in which the
      Grainger porcelain works were shut down.

    <h2>Type 2</h2>

    <p>
      Type 2 backstamps have <b>C51</b> in a circle topped by a crown.
      RW was founded in 1751, hence the
      significance of C51 in their backstamp motifs.
      Around the inside of the circle is the stylized <b>W</b> that
      looks like wavy lines.  Around the bottom of the circle 
      written <b>ROYAL WORCESTER ENGLAND</b>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Royal Worcester used a set of dot markings, starting in 1891,
      where the number 
      of dots on either side of the crwon or among or below the words of the
      backstamp indicate the year of manufacture of the piece.  The number of
      dots indicate a the year of manufacture  of the piece.  1891 had no
      dots (the crown had a new design).  1892 had one dot to the left of the
      crown.  1893 had two dots, one on either side of the crown, and so on,
      up to 1915, where there are twenty-four dots, six on either side of
      the crown in two rows, and  twelve beneath the words.
      In 1916 RW started adding other symbols and marks to the dot code.  RW
      continues to use date coding on some pieces.  On egg coddlers, it
      seems that they stopped using the date codes early.
    </p>

    <p>
      Type 2A and Type 2B coddlers have a reference number,
      <b>R<SUP>d</SUP>N<SUP>o</SUP> 
	#561564</b> in a box below the circle.  According to
      <a href="/sources/#KM">KM</a>, this would be an English registry mark,
      and if so, the design was registered in 1909 with the British Patent
      Office. The <a href="../threads.shtml">screw
	threads</a> are finer-pitched.
    </p>
    
    <br />
    
    <a name="Type2A"></a>
    <h2>Type 2A</h2>

    <p>
      The backstamp is red. This mark has been seen
      on a coddler with a silver lid. The example shown has twenty dots, and so
      it's believed that the year of manufacture was 1911.  The lid is
      hallmarked 1912. (<a href="/sources/#BB">BB</a>).

      This backstamp is black.  It is like 2A and 2B, without the

    <br />

    <a name="Type3"></a>
    <h2>Type 3</h2>

    <p>
      Type 3 backstamps consist of the characters <b>C51</b>
      in a circle topped by a crown.    Around the top of the
      circle are the words <b>ROYAL WORCESTER</b>.
      Beneath the circle appears <b>ENGLAND</b>.
      There are banners on either side of the circle
      in which the words <b>CROWN</b> and <b>WARE</b> appear.
      The backstamp on Type 3 coddlers is dull green in color.  The
      backstamp is underneath the glaze (i.e., it can't be scraped off with
      a fingernail, although
      <i>we don't recommend doing this as a test, especially on an older
	coddler</i>).  The <a href="../threads.shtml">screw threads</a> 
      are finer-pitched.
      The pedestal is often smaller than on the other types of RW
      coddlers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Some Type 3 backstamps have the Royal Worcester dot marking codes,
      beneath the circle and above <b>ENGLAND</b>.

    <h2>Type 4</h2>

    <p>
      Type 4 is actually a set of backstamps.  Most of the Type 4 backstamps
      have <b>C51</b> in a circle topped by a crown.  Around the top of the
      circle is written <b>ROYAL WORCESTER VITREOUS</b> or just
      <b>ROYAL WORCESTER</b>.  Under the circle is written
      <b>MADE IN ENGLAND</b> or just <b>ENGLAND</b>.  In some cases there
      are additional words stamped or superimposed onto the basic design.
      the backstamp is dull green in color
      and is underneath the glaze.

      The backstamps of Type 5 coddlers all have
      the stylized script <b>W</b> in the center of the circle. The subtypes
      are distinguished by the words and placement of them in the backstamp
      design.  All Type 5 coddlers have the finer-pitched (tighter, or

      above and <b>HOTEL CHINA</b> below around the outside of the circle.
      Across the top of the backstamp are the words
      <b>MADE IN ENGLAND</b>. 
      This coddler was probably manufactured for the restaurant trade.

    <h2>Type 9</h2>

    <p>
      Type 9 coddlers have a backstamp with the stylized script <b>W</b>
      inside a circle. Outside the circle appears <b>ROYAL WORCESTER</b>
      above and <b>PORCELAIN</b> below around the outside of the circle.
      Beneath that is <b>MADE IN ENGLAND</b> in smaller type.  The
      <a href="../threads.shtml">screw threads</a>
      are of the newer, less-dense pitch.   The backstamp of Type 9
      is black  and is imprinted over the glaze.
      This backstamp is similar to several other types.

    <h2>Type 10</h2>

    <p>
      Type 10 coddlers have a backstamp with the stylized script <b>W</b>,
      with the Registered Trademark symbol <b>&reg;</b> to the lower
      right, inside a circle.  Outside the circle appears <b>ROYAL
	WORCESTER</b> above and <b>PORCELAIN</b> below around the outside of
      the circle.  Beneath that is <b>MADE IN ENGLAND</b> in smaller type.
      The <a href="../threads.shtml">screw threads</a>
      are of the newer, less-dense pitch.   The backstamp of Type 10
      is black and is imprinted over the glaze.  The rim of the coddler
      is made of white vinyl.  Type 10 differs from
      <a href="#Type11">Type 11</a>
      only in that Type 11 has a metal rim.

      <ul>
	<b>Note:</b> I have recently seen a coddler of the
	<a href="../evesham">Evesham design</a>
	that has a
	<a href="#Type9">Type 9</a>
	backstamp and a nylon rim,

      Type 12 coddlers have a  backstamp with the
      <b>C51</b> in a circle topped by a crown. The inner scrollwork of the
      circle appears to be stylized script <b>W</b>s at the top, bottom,
      left, and right.  Around the outside of the circle, 
      is written <b>ROYAL WORCESTER &reg; FINE PORCELAIN</b>.

      <a href="#Type8">Type  8</a>,

      we are providing a table of metrics that you can use to identify
      these backstamps:

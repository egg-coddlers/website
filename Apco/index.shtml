<h1>Royal Sealy Egg Coddlers</h1></a>

We don't know much for sure about this coddler, other than the fact
that it exists.  The pattern is called Moss Rose.  Unlike most
coddlers we've seen, this coddler has a painted metal strap that holds
the lid onto the coddler.  One
<a href="/sources/#EA">eBay auctioneer</a>
indicated that there were removable labels on the example for sale,
one with <b>Apco</b> and another with <b>Japan</b>.  We don't know if
these labels came with the coddler or were "acquired" later.
<p>
We assume this to be Royal Sealy (RS) by association with other
pieces.  4" in height, with the pattern of a rose on a stem on one
side, a rosebud on a stem on the other.

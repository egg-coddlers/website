<h1>Sources and Reliability of Information</h1>
</center>

We have gathered data from many different sources of different
reliability.  It's very confusing to keep track of facts, separate
them from rumors, suspicions, and wild guesses.  This page documents
what those sources are, and what degree of reliability that we place
in those sources in some cases.

<a name="BB"></a>
<b>Bruce Barrett</b> -

    Bruce is a co-author of this web space, and has contributed most of
    the factual data and many of the images that make this site the
    reference resource that it is.  Bruce has been collecting egg
    coddlers for many years.
    Any data that is annotated with the source notation
    <b>BB</b> has been verified by Bruce.  Such data generally
    comes from his own collection or from another reliable source of
    information.   In many cases data so marked comes from his own
    manifest of egg coddler patterns and styles that he has been
    working on for many years.
    <p>
    Bruce is always looking to meet (electronically) other collectors
    of coddlers in order to buy or trade for coddlers that he needs
    for his collection.

<b><u>Miller's Pottery and Porcelain Marks</u> by Gordon Lang.</b> -
    Perhaps the most useful guide to maker's marks and date codes on
    ceramics that Rob has found, to date.  Furthermore, it is in a
    3&frac12; x 7&frac12; hardbound book format ... it travels comfortably
    with you as you roam the antiques stores.  In addition to marks
    from manufacturers around the world, the book includes brief
    historical blurbs about the factories as they have changed hands
    over the years.  (<i>London: Reed International Books, Ltd.,
    1995. ISBN 1-85732-615-6.</i>).

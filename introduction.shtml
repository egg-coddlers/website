<h1>Introduction ... What is an Egg Coddler?</h1>

An egg coddler is a porcelain or pottery cup with a lid that is used
to prepare a dish called, appropriately enough, <i>coddled eggs</i>.
Coddled eggs are very much like poached eggs, except that the egg is
cooked inside the coddler.  The egg(s) are broken into the buttered coddler,
and seasonings are added, if desired.  The coddler is then closed with
the lid and partially immersed in boiling water for a few minutes.
When the eggs are cooked to the desired firmness, the coddler is
lifted from the boiling water, the lid removed, and breakfast is
served, in a lovely decorated dish.

<td>Egg coddlers are often painted or glazed with a design.  There are
many different patterns and designs, which makes them highly suitable
as practical gifts for the kitchen, or for addition to the china collection.
Egg coddlers are also very desirable as collectibles.  The example to
the left here was manufactured and sold by
<a href="RoyalWorcester">
Royal Worcester</a> (RW).  The pattern of this particular coddler is
called
<a href="RoyalWorcester/june-garland">June Garland</a>.
RW claims to have invented the egg coddler in the late Nineteenth
Century and continues to manufacture them to this day.

<td>Egg coddlers have a lid, made out of metal, or porcelain, that is
attached to the top of the coddler before cooking.  Many coddlers are
manufactured with a set of screw-on threads at the lip of the
coddler.  The threads on the coddler are often either a metal, such as
stainless steel, or a plastic, such as white nylon.   The lid will
have a complementary screw thread that holds it to the coddler during
cooking.  In some examples, neither the lid nor the coddler are
threaded, and instead the lid is attached by a metal strap across the
top that hooks onto "ears" on the side of the coddler.

Syracuse</a>,
manufacturer of the

Premier Egg Coddler</a>
around the turn of the century, made coddlers with metal lids and no
lifting ring.  This example to the left has a porcelain lid with screw
threads,  and the threads at the top of the coddler are also porcelain.
We suspect that this example shown may have been manufactured by

<h1>Related Objects Not Covered by This Site</h1>

There are other collectible objects out there that are sometimes
described in auctions as egg coddlers.  What's in a name?  Well,
without getting into a philosophical discussion of linguistics
... nothing.  However, for the purpose of this site, we will exclude
any number of objects that are often described as egg coddlers.

<p>
Purists may call these other objects egg caddies, egg cups, egg warmers,
or egg servers instead of egg coddlers.  Quite frankly, I don't
believe it's necessary to be so pedantic.  These objects were all 
designed to handle eggs ... to cook them or present them for
consumption.  We can consider them all to be "close personal friends"
and/or "distant relatives" of the egg coddlers that we study and
discuss here on this site.

        the table.  There are many collectors that are interested in
        egg cups, and indeed, there is a much greater variety of egg
        cups to collect than egg coddlers.  However, this site will
        stick to egg coddlers.  This example here is by Herend with
        the Blue Garland pattern.

    <td>Modern technology run amuck!  These little plastic cups were
        designed so that you can fix up something like coddled eggs in

        similar to coddling eggs.  I'm sure that the inspiration for
        the shape comes from egg coddlers.  However, calling these egg
        coddlers would  be pushing the envelope a bit too much.  These
        and similar products are available in the 2000's.

<h1>Lorrie Egg Coddlers</h1>
</a>

We are listing these coddlers, tentatively, under the manufacturer
name of Lorrie.  We don't know for certain if Lorrie is the
manufacturer, the artist, or the distributor of these coddlers.

<p>
All examples of this style of coddler that we've seen are double-sized
coddlers (4 &frac12; inches tall), with a picture of a chick in a
nest.  This design can be found in a convex version with a pedestal,
and a concave version.  The lifting rings are round and square.

<p>
These coddlers don't have any backstamp or manufacturer's marks on
them.  Some are found with a paper tag that contains the words
<b>Design by Lorrie</b> and others have been found with removable
stickers with the word <b>Japan</b>.  The fact that there are convex
and concave designs implies that they were <i>possibly</i> (as in very
remotely possible) manufactured by
<a href="/Shafford/">Shafford</a>.  Another correspondant has proposed
that they are made in Germany.

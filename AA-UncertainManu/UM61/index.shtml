    <h1>Unknown Manufacturer - UM61 (Red and Blue Flowered Pattern)</h1>

    <p>
      This is a double-size coddler, with a large pedestal and a round
      lifting ring. The pattern consists of red and blue stylised
      flowers around the rim, with a red line around the base. We have
      only ever seen these coddlers for sale in Germany, and suspect a
      German Manufacturer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The packaging says <b>GLOBE SHOPPER</b>, <b>Schlemmer-Ei</b>
      (Gourmet Egg), <b>mit rostfreiem Deckel</b> (with stainless
      lid).

    <p>
    At Mardi Gras, there are organizations that are called Krewes.
    Some Krewes parade and some only hold a Mardi Gras Ball.  Most of
    the Krewes that parade also have a Bal Masque (Ball).  At the
    ball, the guest of each Krewe member is called out from the
    audience to dance with that Krewe member.  After the dance has
    ended, the guest receives a favor (a gift).  Favors from a Bal
    Masque are also known as <i>Call Out Ball Favors</i>.

    <p>
    This coddler was given as a gift to friends and other Krewe
  members by the King of Mid City during Mardi Gras, 1980.  The Krewe
  of Mid City (KMC) began in 1934 and is still in existence today.
  Mid City is known mostly as a parade having the most marching
  bands. They invite high school, college, Army, Navy, Marine and any
  other marching group to parade and play their instruments as they
  march.  The theme "Happiness Is" was carried through the parade and the 
  Ball.

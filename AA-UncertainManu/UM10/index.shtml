<h1>Uncertain Manufacturer - UM10</h1>

We are cross-referencing this group of coddlers, of uncertain
manufacturer origin, with the
<a href="/Lorrie/">Lorrie</a>
group.  Lorrie could be a distributor or a reseller instead of the
manufacturer ... we don't know.  We have seen examples of these
with an attached paper tag that includes the words
<b>Designs by Lorrie</b>.

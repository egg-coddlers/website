    Uncertain Manufacturer - UM02

    These coddlers are double-sized convex with no pedestal.
    The pattern consists of a version of the classic Willow pattern
    in blue and white.  These are similar to the
    <a href="/RoyalWorcester/willow/">Royal Worcester</a>
    version of the
    <a href="/RoyalWorcester/willow/">Willow pattern</a>.

    These coddlers have no backstamp.

<ul>
    <b><i>Note:</i></b> --&nbsp;
        Most metal-liddered coddlers can be damaged if the lid is
        screwed back on to the coddler while it or the coddler rim is
        wet.  The two pieces of metal rust and fuse, and then part
        company with the porcelain when one next attempts to unscrew
        the lid.  Usually, this can be corrected without much effort,
        but sometimes the rust weld is just too strong.  This
        particular coddler seems very susceptible to this.
        Three of the five coddlers of this type that I've seen have
        had the problem.  I suspect that this is because the chrome
        plating is especially thin and the surface area of contact
        between lid and coddler is especially large.

<h1>
    Unknown Manufacturer - UM42 (Pink or Purple Flowers)
</h1>    

    This is a double-sized cylindrical coddler.  The pattern consists of
    pink or purple flowers.  We're not sure if the different shades on
    different examples are intentional, the result of wear, or simply
    the difference in image quality.  Marked <b>Japan</b> on the
    backstamp.  The pattern appears on both "sides" of the coddler.
    
<p>
    These coddlers were sold with a small booklet of recipes (shown
    below) that gives no indication of the manufacturer.
    
<p>    
    Some examples of these coddlers had a small sticker, with the
    word <b>BIRKS</b> and <b>BB</b> (one of the B's reversed), in
    addition to <b>Japan</b> in the porcelain.

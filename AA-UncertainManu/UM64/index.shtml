<h1>Unknown Manufacturer - UM64 (Hand-painted Coddlers)</h1>
</a>

<p>
    Egg coddlers that were originally plain white, then hand-painted
    by the purchaser (and then sold). We have no idea how many different
    variations of manufacturer / design there are. This category is not
    for a unique manufacturer, but for any hand-painted egg-coddler that
    we've encountered.

<p>
    The following coddlers are similar in shape and the unpainted
    originals were probably made by manufacturer

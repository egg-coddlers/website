    Unknown Manufacturer - UM04
    </h1>

<p>    
    These are double-sized ceramic egg coddlers, plain-white glaze,
    with no distinguishing marks.  The shape is convex with no 
    pedestal.  The lifting ring is round.  The shapes vary slightly in
    curvature near the base and near the rim.  The lids differ
    slightly as well.
    </p>
<p>
    Sometimes these are seen with removable <b>Made in Japan</b>
    stickers.
    </p>
<p>
    We have heard of a similar coddler with a square lifting ring but
    do not have images.  If you have one in your collection and can
    send us images, please
    <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.

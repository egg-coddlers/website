    <h1>Unknown Manufacturer - UM01</h1>

    <p>
      These coddlers are similar in shape to <a href="/Wade">Wade</a>
      double coddlers.  Most of them are painted or glazed a single
      colour. All these coddlers are made of pottery, including the lid,
      and the lifting ring. These coddlers come in a single and a double size.
    </p>

    <p>
      These coddlers are all very similar in style, and so we have
      assumed that they are by a single manufacturer.  However, there are
      subtle differences in shape, style, and backstamps -- it is
      possible that  more than one manufacturer, or licensee, was
      involved in producing these.
    </p>

    <ul>
      There is circumstantial evidence to suggest that at least some
      were made by <a href="/RoyalWorcester/">RW</a>. One that I bought
      came in a box that was very similar to the boxes that RW uses:
      same blue colour, with <b>Made in England</b> 
      on the side, but no other markings. The paperwork that came with
      it refers to <b>Epicure's Choice</b>.
      A very similar phrase is used by RW to decribe their
      <b>Epicure's Delight</b> coddlers. -- <a href="/sources/#BB">BB</a>.
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some of the lids of these coddlers are inscribed with the British
      ceramic registration number <b>Regd 720797</b>.

    <h2>Date Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not have any means of accurately calculating the date of
      manufacture of these coddlers.  However, we can make an estimate
      at the earliest date of manufacture of the style, using the
      British registration numbers and American patent numbers.  British
      Registration Number 636,774 was issued in 1914.  The U.S. Design
      Patent Application for Patent 49,405 was filed on May 22,
      1916. British Registration Number 720,797 was issued in 1927.
      Note that a piece may have been manufactured years, or even
      decades, after the design was registered or patented.  If the lid
      is inscribed with <b>Regd 720797</b> you can be sure that it was
      not manufactured before 1927.
    </p>


    <h2>Sizes</h2>
    <p>
      There are two sizes of the coddlers in this style.
    </p>

    <a name="Single"></a>
    <p>
      The <b>single</b> size egg coddler in this style is 3 &frac12;
      inches tall, from the base to the top of the lifting ring, with
      the lid screwed onto the body.  This size is 2
      <tiny><sup>15</sup>/<sub>16</sub></tiny> inches in diameter at the
      top of the body of the coddler.
    </p>

    <a name="Double"></a>
    <p>
      The <b>double</b> size egg coddler in this style is 4 &frac12;
      inches tall.

    <h2>Dipping Stands</h2>
    <p>
      In some cases, these coddlers were sold in sets of two or four,
      with a metal "dipping stand" that would be used to lower and raise
      the coddlers into a pan of boiling water for cooking.  Some examples
      are shown below.

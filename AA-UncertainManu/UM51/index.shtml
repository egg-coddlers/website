<h1>Unknown Manufacturer - UM51</h1>
</a>

    These coddlers were made for the mass market or for everyday use
    (instead of your nice collectable coddlers).  They come in three
    colours: white, yellow, and blue. They were sold (in 2001) by
    <a href="http://thehomemarketplace.com">
    The Home Marketplace</a>,
    in pairs.
    <p>
    These coddlers are 4&frac12; inches tall from the base to the top
    of the lifting ring.  They are cylindrical in shape, with a
    recessed pedestal.  There is no backstamp or other markings on the
    coddler.  The lifting ring is rectangular and curved at the top.
    <p>
    The packaging indicates that these coddlers were
    <b>Made in China for R.S.V.P. International, Inc. Seattle
    WA</b>.

<h1>
    UM49 are not Egg Coddlers
</h1>

    After careful study and consultation with other collectors, we've
    come to the conclusion that the objects that were assigned UM49
    are, in fact, decorated Japanese tea cups, with covers.  We've
    included some pictures
    <a href="/introduction.shtml#OutOfScope">
    in our introductory page</a>
    with examples of "What an Egg Coddler is Not" (within the scope of this site).

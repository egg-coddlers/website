Unknown Manufacturer - UM37
</h1>

    These are double-sized ceramic concave
    egg coddlers, similar in shape to those made by
    <a href="/Sigma/">Sigma</a>
    or
    <a href="/Shafford/">Shafford</a>.
    The coddler has a plain white glaze, and no backstamp.
    <p>
    We have heard of this coddler but we do not have images.  If you
    have one in your collection and can send us images, please
    <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.

<h1>Unknown Manufacturer - UM45 (Alhambra Krewe 1980)</h1>
</a>

    This is a double-sized convex coddler with no pedestal.  The
    pattern consists of a coat of arms on one side, with the words
    <b>KREWE OF ALHAMBRA</b>, and on the other side a castle, with the
    words <b>MERRIE OLDE ENGLAND</b> and <b>1980</b> in pennants at
    the top and bottom.  There is no backstamp
    
    <p>
    It is very likely that this Mardi Gras coddler was made by the
    same manufacturer as
    <a href="/AA-UncertainManu/UM44/">UM44-UNK01</a>.

    <p>
    At Mardi Gras, there are organizations that are called Krewes.
    Some Krewes parade and some only hold a Mardi Gras Ball.  Most of
    the Krewes that parade also have a Bal Masque (Ball).  At the
    ball, the guest of each Krewe member is called out from the
    audience to dance with that Krewe member.  After the dance has
    ended, the guest receives a favor (a gift).  Favors from a Bal
    Masque are also known as <i>Call Out Ball Favors</i>.
    
    <p>
    This coddler was given as a gift to guests, as a Mardi Gras Ball
    Favor, at the 1980 ball of the Krewe of Alhambra.  The theme of
    the dance was "Merrie Olde England". The Krewe of Alhambra began
    in 1947 and is still in existence today (2000).

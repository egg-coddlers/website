    <h1>Pattern UM03-UNK03 (Two Birds)</h1>

    <p>
      These coddlers are double-sized convex coddlers with no pedestal
      and have corrugated sides.  The shape is the same as coddlers made
      by <a href="/HouseOfPrill/">House of Prill</a> but they have no
      backstamp.  The pattern consists of two coloured birds.  One has
      blue, black, green and a belly of yellow with orange spots.  The
      other bird's head is green and black with blue and black back and
      yellow belly. The birds are on a green branch with small fuchsia
      pink flowers and three tiny orange flowers on a top branch.  This
      design appears on only one side of the coddler.

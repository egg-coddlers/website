    <h1>Pattern UM03-UNK19 (Bunch of Blue Flowers - with a Red Ribbon)</h1>

    <p>
      These coddlers are double-sided convex coddlers with no pedestal.
      They have corrugated sides.  The pattern is identical to
      pattern <a href="/Windsor/WIN-UNK12/">Windsor - WIN-UNK15</a>,
      and the shape is the same as the shape of coddlers made by
      <a href="/HouseOfPrill">House of Prill</a>,
      but these have no backstamp.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This pattern is a bunch very delicate blue flowers with a red ribbon.  
      The design appears on only one side of the coddler.

    Pattern UM03-UNK19 (Bunch of Blue Flowers - with a Red Ribbon)
</h1>

    These coddlers are double-sided convex coddlers with no pedestal.
    They have corrugated sides.  The shape is the same as the
    shape of coddlers made by
    <a href="/HouseOfPrill">House of Prill</a>,
    but these have no backstamp.
    <p>
    This pattern is a bunch very delicate blue flowers with a red ribbon.  
    The design appears on only one side of the coddler.

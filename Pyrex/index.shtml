    <h1>Pyrex Egg Coddlers</h1>

    <p>
      Pyrex has made several different styles of egg coddlers.
      At least one style is documented on page 28 of the book
      <u>Pyrex ... the Unauthorized Collector's Guide</u>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The style designations given below are our own invention for
      distinguishing between coddlers.

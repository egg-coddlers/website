<h1>Schott & Gen Mainz Egg Coddlers</h1>
</a>

These are glass egg coddlers with a metal clip to hold down the lid
during cooking.  The backstamp markings are embossed (molded) into the
glass.  The words are <b>Schott & Gen Mainz</b> in a circle that is
inside a square.  Beneath the square is the marking <b>Jenaer
Glas</b>. 
<p>
<a href="/sources/#BB">Bruce</a> notes:
<ul>
    There are two variations. One with three legs and the other with
    four. The two also differ slightly in width and the shape of the clip.
</ul>
<p>
Pictured are some images of a three-legged version that was sold
recently at an
<a href="/sources/#EA">eBay auction</a>.  The backstamp details
are a bit difficult to make out as it is difficult to photograph clear
glass well.

<h1>WMF of America Egg Coddlers</h1>

These are double-sized egg coddlers made out of clear glass.  The base
is decorated with a chicken in relief.  The backstamp consists of the
letter <b>W</b> over <b>MF</b> in relief.  There is also a number,
usually near the outside of the backstamp, to the right of the letters
(when viewed with the letters upright).
We know of examples with the following numbers on the back:
<b>1</b>,
<b>2</b>,
<b>3</b>,
<b>4</b>,
<b>6</b>,
<b>7</b>,
<b>8</b>,
and
<b>10</b>.
<p>
    These coddlers are known in one size: 4&frac12; inches from the
    base to the top of the lifting ring, and 2&frac12; inches in
    diameter at the mouth.

<p>
    These coddlers were manufactured by the U.S. subsidiary of Wutternberg
    Metal Fabrik of Germany.   Some were sold in sets with
    salt and pepper shakers.  The parent company still exists today
    as
    <a href="http://wmf.de/english/indexenglish.htm">
    Württembergische Metallwarenfabrik AG</a>.

<p>
    Some of these coddlers were sold in pairs.  The package had 
    a label that included the text <b>WMF Fraser's Chicken
    Coop</b> and <b>Content 2 egg coddlers</b> with recipes on the
    reverse side.

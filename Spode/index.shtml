<h1>Spode Egg Coddlers</h1>

    At present, we know very little about whether Spode ever
    manufactured egg coddlers.  There is one egg coddler that
    has the <b>Spode</b> name on the back, with the classic
    Spode "Christmas Tree" design, but that was manufactured
    by
    <a href="/RoyalWorcester/spode-xmas-tree/">
    Royal Worcester</a>.

    <p>
    Pictured here is an old convex coddler with a pedestal (missing
    the lid).  It is decorated with the classic blue Willow pattern.
    The Willow pattern was developed by Josiah Spode I (1733-1797),
    and the company that bears his name,
    <a href="http://www.spode.co.uk"><b>Spode, Ltd.</b></a>
    exists to this day.  The company was sold in 1833 to
    W.T. Copeland, and bore the names <b>Copeland & Garrett</b>
    from 1833 to 1847, and <b>W.T. Copeland and Sons</b>
    from 1847 to 1970.  The backstamp of this coddler is worn with
    age, but the name <b>Copeland</b> can be made out.

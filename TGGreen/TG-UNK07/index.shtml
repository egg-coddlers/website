    <h1>
      T.G. Green - Pattern TG-UNK07
    </h1>

    <p>
      These coddlers are convex, with a pedestal, and have a
      a <b>flat</b> lifting ring.  This coddler design is unlike many of
      the other T.G. Green convex coddlers, in that the "hips" of the
      coddler are much more pronounced.
    </p>

    <p>
      The coddler is decorated with a spray of pink flowers as the main
      theme with many smaller pink flowers all around.  The pattern
      surrounds the coddler and seems to extend to the base as well.

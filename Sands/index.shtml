      Egg Coddlers by Sands      
    </h1>

    <p>
      Egg coddlers that are double-sized with concave body style and a
      square lifting ring. We don't know whether these were
      manufactured by Sands or manufactured by a third party and
      distributed by Sands.
      </p>

    <p>
      We know of two series of patterns by Sands:
      <a href="#HollyHobbie">Holly Hobbie</a>
      and
      <a href="#TinyTalk">Tiny Talk</a>. The pattern identifiers are
      our own -- we don't know what the manufacturer's pattern name is.
      </p>

    <p>
      We are interested in hearing from collectors who have these, or
      similar egg coddlers in their collection. Please
      <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you do.
      </p>

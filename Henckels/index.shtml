    <h1>Henckels</h1>

    <p>
      These are double-sized, convex coddlers, with an octahedral horizontal
      cross-section.  It's hard to tell from the photos, but the coddler
      has 8 flat surfaces instead of the  usual round exterior.  They have
      a tiny pedestal, also octahedral, and a round
      lifting ring.  There is no identifying markings or backstamp.
      Most examples of these egg coddlers that we have seen were
      located in Germany. We believe that they were made or sold by
      J. A. Henckels.

    <h3>HE-UNK01</h3>
    <p>
      The pattern consists of tiny pink flowers with green leaves - four
      rows of flowers with 13 flowers in each row.
    </p>

    <p>
      This coddler came with a brochure of recipes in three languages:
      French, English, and German ... but no indication of manufacturer.
      There was also a picture of four other coddlers, that we've never seen
      examples of.  We have no idea whether they were made by the same
      manufacturer ... from the picture, they might all have the same
      octahedral shape as this one.

    <h1>McKee Glasbake Egg Coddlers</h1>
    
    <p>
      These items are marginally egg coddlers: the advertisements and
      packaging materials refer to them as "egg cookers."  They are made
      of clear glass, sometimes ribbed, and sometimes plain.  The lid of
      the coddler does not screw onto the body, it simply rests on the
      body of the coddler.  Some of the lids have a small hole,
      presumbably to relieve pressure build-up while cooking the eggs.
      The lids are known to exist in two materials: maroon Bakelite, and
      aluminum.  The metal lids have a small knob for a handle.  This
      knob can be colored wood (red, black, or maroon).  Also, there
      were lids that were entirely made of aluminum.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These coddlers were sold in sets of two, three, or four, often
      with a metal rack that could be used to remove the set of coddlers
      from the boiling water.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some information about these coddlers comes from a collectors'
      book published in 1983, <u>The Miracle in Grandmother's Kitchen</u>
      by Glyndon Shirley.  That book includes a reproduction of a page
      from a 1937 Sears catalog offering McKee Glasbake items.  The text
      of that page includes the following: <b>New Egg Boiler</b>,
      <b>Break eggs in cups; cover, and set in boiling water. Serve at
	table. Metal covers. With wire rack.<p>
	  <ul>
            Shpg. wt., 2 lbs. ........11 E 4922...Set of 3...52 cents<br>
            Shpg. wt., 2 lbs. 10 oz...11 E 4903...Set of 4...69 cents<br>
	  </ul>
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      The style designations given below are our own invention for
      distinguishing between coddlers.

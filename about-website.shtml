    <h2>How the Site Came to Be</h2>
    <p>
      <i>
	Once upon a time there was a woman who acquired a pair of
	<a href="/RoyalWorcester">Royal Worcester</a> egg coddlers
	with the <a href="/RoyalWorcester/evesham/">Evesham</a>
	pattern.   We don't know where she got them, or why she
	did.  We do know that she made coddled eggs for her husband and
	her only daughter.   Eventually, the woman passed away, and her
	daughter acquired the egg coddlers.  The daughter was very fond of
	the egg coddlers because they remind her of her mother.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      In her wanderings through antiques stores, years later, the
      daughter finds other egg coddlers and starts a modest collection
      of the coddlers that she finds very pretty and in undamaged
      condition.  Her husband, who occasionally wanders with her through
      the antiques stores, begins to wonders whether there is any
      information about egg coddlers on the
      Internet.
    </p>

    <p>
      The husband, Rob, discovered that there were many varieties of
      these egg coddler designs ... dozens ... maybe even hundreds.
      It seemed that there were as many as ninety of the little
      beasties for sale on  
      <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
      alone.  Rob decided to create an online catalog of egg coddlers,
      based on the data that he could glean from auctions and other
      online resources. It was created originally for his wife, but
      maybe other collectors could benefit or contribute to Rob's
      research as well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <i>Rob had a lot to learn about egg coddlers</i>. 
      Sellers in online auctions are not always consistent or correct
      about the names of the coddlers that they are selling.
      One day, two weeks after becoming an online egg coddler
      "expert," he noticed that a seller of egg coddlers had misnamed
      an egg coddler. He contacted the seller to find out why he had
      the "wrong" name for the pattern on his auction.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="/sources/#BB">Bruce</a> had been collecting egg
      coddlers for many years.  Rob learned, after a quick E-mail
      exchange, that Bruce knew a great deal about egg coddlers. Bruce
      seemed to know everything about egg coddlers that there was to
      know.   He had meticulously kept notes on everything 
      he had ever learned about egg coddlers.  One day, he would write a
      book to share his knowledge with other collectors.  Rob was
      astounded by the depth of Bruce's notes ... he wanted to buy two
      copies of the (as-yet unwritten) book.  After some back-and-forth
      conversation, Bruce decided to partner with Rob and publish his
      knowledge on the Internet, with technical assistance from Rob. 
    </p>

    </p>Thus was born
      <a href="http://www.egg-coddlers.com">Egg-Coddlers.COM</a>. Eighteen
      years later, we are still learning new facts about egg coddlers,
      usually from collectors and sellers in the secondary markets.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our goal is to make this web site a repository of information about egg
      coddlers on the Internet. We want to provide a forum for egg
      coddler collectors to meet and communicate and share their
      knowledge and learn from other collectors.  As time
      goes on, we hope that other collectors of egg coddlers will share
      their knowledge (and pictures of examples) with us, so that
      ultimately, if there is something to know about an egg coddler, you
      can find it via this site.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you have questions, comments, complaints, kudos, suggestions,
      or anything else to share with the authors/editors/maintainers of

    <h2>What We Do</h2>

    <p>
      This website is an information site for collectors of egg
      coddlers. Our goal is to provide a compendium of information
      about egg coddlers ... as much as we can gather and present.
      </p>

    <p>
      <div style="font-size: large">
        <b>We don't sell anything shown on this web site.</b>
      </div>

        Please do not <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> to buy egg
        coddlers shown on this web site.
        Nothing shown is for sale by us. Most of the egg coddlers are
        no longer manufactured and can't be purchased new. You will
        want to look online at auction sites and companies that sell
        replacement pieces.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      As a matter of policy, the editors of this web site will not
      publish any information about pricing, relative scarcity, or
      rarity of individual egg coddlers. We
      don't put that information on the web site, and we will not
      respond to contact inquiries about "how rare is my egg
      coddler" or "what is my egg coddler worth."

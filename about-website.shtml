    <h2>How the Site Came to Be</h2>
    <p>
      <i>
	Once upon a time there was a woman who acquired a pair of
	<a href="/RoyalWorcester">Royal Worcester</a> egg coddlers
	with the <a href="/RoyalWorcester/evesham/">Evesham</a>
	pattern.   We don't know where she got them, or why she
	did.  We do know that she made coddled eggs for her husband and
	her only daughter.   Eventually, the woman passed away, and her
	daughter acquired the egg coddlers.  The daughter was very fond of
	the egg coddlers because they remind her of her mother.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      In her wanderings through antiques stores, years later, the
      daughter finds other egg coddlers and starts a modest collection
      of the coddlers that she finds very pretty and in undamaged
      condition.  Her husband, who occasionally wanders with her through
      the antiques stores, has blithely failed to pay much attention to
      her coddler collection.  Then, one weekend after they find several
      coddlers at an antiques store, the husband suddenly wonders if
      there is any information to be found about egg coddlers on the
      Internet.  <i>Pandora's Box had been opened</i>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In wandering through the Internet, the husband (who will be
      referred to from here on as
      <a href="http://www.spotch.com/">Rob</a>)
      discovered that there were many varieties of these egg coddler
      designs ... dozens ... maybe even hundreds.  It seemed that there
      were as many as ninety of the little beasties for sale on 
      <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
      alone.  Rob decided to create an online catalog of egg coddlers,
      based on the data that he could glean from auctions and other
      online resources.  He created this first web site as a home page
      for the daughter (who will be referred to from here on as
      Paula).  Rob believed
      that having a catalog of egg coddlers would help Paula with her
      collection, and what better medium than a web page?  Then other
      collectors of egg coddlers could benefit from Rob's research as well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <i>Rob and Paula had a lot to learn about egg coddlers</i>.  An
      interesting note about the auctions on
      <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
      is that people are not always consistent about naming the coddlers
      that they are selling.  One day, (two weeks into becoming an
      online egg coddler expert) Rob noticed that a seller of egg
      coddlers was naming 
      <a href="/RoyalWorcester/june-garland/">a pretty floral pattern</a>
      with the name that Rob had believed belonged to
      <a href="/RoyalWorcester/birds/">a pattern with birds</a>.
      Rob decided to contact the seller to find out why he had the
      "wrong" name.

      <i>Enter Bruce, Stage Left</i>.
      <a href="/sources/#BB">Bruce</a> has been collecting egg
      coddlers for many years.  Rob learned, after a quick E-mail
      exchange, that Bruce knew an awful lot about egg coddlers.  In
      fact, Bruce seemed to know everything about egg coddlers that
      there was to know.   He had meticulously kept notes on everything
      he had ever learned about egg coddlers.  One day, he would write a
      book to share his knowledge with other collectors.  Rob was
      astounded by the depth of Bruce's notes ... he wanted to buy two
      copies of the (as-yet unwritten) book.  After some back-and-forth
      conversation, Bruce decided to publish his knowledge on the
      Internet, with technical assistance from Rob.   Thus was born
      <a href="http://www.egg-coddlers.com">Egg-Coddlers.COM</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our goal is to make this web site a repository of information about egg
      coddlers on the Internet.  Don't let the ".COM" part of the name
      mislead you ... this is a non-commercial site ... we want to
      provide a forum for egg coddler collectors to meet and communicate
      and share their knowledge and learn from other collectors.  As time
      goes on, we hope that other collectors of egg coddlers will share
      their knowledge (and pictures of examples) with us, so that
      ultimately, if there is something to know about an egg coddler, you
      can find it via this site.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you have questions, comments, complaints, kudos, suggestions,
      or anything else to share with the authors/editors/maintainers of
      this site, please
      <a href="/contact/">use this link</a>
      to send us a message.  If, for whatever reason, that link does not
      work for you, you can send an E-mail message to the following address:
      <b>ecc-editors_AT_egg-coddlers_DOT_com</b>.  You will have to
      manually change the "_AT_" to an '@' character, and the "_DOT_" to
      a '.' character before using that address.

      <i>It is only fair to say that Paula is slightly overwhelmed with
	the extent to which Rob has expanded her little hobby into a massive
	production.  However, her coddler collection has benefitted, so she
	can't complain too much. :)</i>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>

    <p>
      This website is an information site for collectors of egg
      coddlers. Our goal is to provide a compendium of information
      about egg coddlers ... as much as we can gather and present.
      </p>

    <p>
      We don't sell the egg coddlers shown on this site. In the past
      we have had sections about "Where to Buy" coddlers, but we're
      going to phase those out because those pages are just impossible
      to keep up-to-date.
      </p>

    <p>
      As a matter of policy, we don't publish any information about
      pricing, relative scarcity, or rarity of individual coddlers. We
      don't put that information on the web site, and we will not
      respond to inquiries in person about "how rare is my egg
      coddler" or "what is my egg coddler worth."

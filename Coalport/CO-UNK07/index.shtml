<h1>
Coalport - CO-UNK07
</h1>

<p>
This pattern is in blue, with crinkled blue and white leaves - of a plant the name of which escapes me.  The backstamp is marked with
<b>ENGLAND</b>,
a crown,
<b>COALPORT</b>,
<b>A.D. 1750</b>,
and
<b>PATENT</b>.
This is a single-sized coddler.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> We know of a version of this coddler that also has a
gold band in the design. We do not yet have a picture.

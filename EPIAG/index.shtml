    EPIAG Coddlers
</h1>

<p>
    We currently assume that this jar with a screw-threaded lid was
    intended for cooking and serving eggs.  That assumption has yet to
    be proven.
<p>
    These coddlers are convex with a small pedestal and no lifting
    ring.  They were made in Bohemia, in Czechoslovakia.
    
<p>
    The pattern is a flower garland with red roses around the centre, with
    a frieze around the top of the coddler.
<p>
    The backstamp is <b>EPIAG</b> above, 
    <b>Czechoslovakia</b> below, and a figure in the middle.
    EPIAG originall stood for Erste B&ouml;hmische Porzellan
    Industrie, A.G., which translates to 
    "First Bohemian Porcelain Industry, A.G."  (A.G. is the German
    abbreviation for Actiengezellschaft, loosely the same thing as
    "Inc." in the U.S.A., or "Ltd." in British countries).
    There is a web site for a current porcelain firm that may be 
    the original factory:

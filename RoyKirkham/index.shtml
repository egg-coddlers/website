    <h1>Roy Kirkham Egg Coddlers</h1>

    <p>
      Roy Kirkham & Co. has been in the ceramics tableware business since at
      least 1970, perhaps longer.  The factory is located in Stoke on
      Trent in England.  The company website is at
      <a href="http://www.roykirkham.co.uk">
	http://www.roykirkham.co.uk</a>.
    </p>

    <p>   
      Roy Kirkham coddlers are mildly convex,  with a tiny
      pedestal, and a small "lip" at the top where the metal rim of the
      lid meets the porcelain body of the coddler.  The lid is metal
      with a round lifting ring.  The coddler measures
      3<font size="-2"><sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub></font> inches
      (108 mm) from
      the base to the top of the lifting ring.  With the lid off, the
      coddler body stands 3&frac14; inches (80 mm) tall.  It is
      approximately 2<font size="-2"><sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub></font>
      inches (61 mm) in diameter (measured at the outside of the rim).
    </p>

    <p>
      Each coddler has a different backstamp that includes the name of
      the pattern,
      <b>AN EXCLUSIVE DESIGN</b>,
      <b>ROY KIRKHAM</b>,
      <b>FINE BONE CHINA</b>,
      <b>ENGLAND</b>,
      a copyright date, and a decal matching the body pattern.

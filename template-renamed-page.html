<h1>
    Pattern %%OLDNAME%% is Named %%NEWNAME%%
</h1>

<p>
    New information has led us to re-evaluate the naming of the
    pattern that was previously here. The pattern that we had named
    %%OLDNAME%% is, to the best of our knowledge, called
    <a href="%%NEWURL%%">%%NEWNAME%%</a>.
    All data about that pattern will be stored in that location.

    If you arrived here through a search engine or a link from outside of
    <a href="/">http://www.egg-coddlers.com</a>
    please alert the site owner to update their index/page.
